# NoSQL-Social-Media-API

## Description

-I wanted to create an a Social Media database for user thoughts and reactions in order to better understand how complex backend DB's work.

-While working through this challenge I ran into a few different problems. First was attempting to set up relationships between the different collections and documents. I got confused with which one would be parent and so forth and how to connect them together using routes and still need help with that. Second, I am still not sure exactly how to create a thought for a single user with reactions and will need to do more studying to figure that out.

-I am grateful to Juan Delgado my tutor, because he was helpful in putting me on the right path with establishing my routes which is the only reason I was able to get this far.
